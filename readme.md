## Day 1: Javascript Drum kit
Today I went through Day 1 of Javascript30 and I was humbled to learn that I did not know a great deal of Vanilla Javascript! You can look at my original solution in the file index-initial.html. 

## Day 2: CSS Analog Clock
I worked on the CSS Analog clock and not to my surprise, there are plenty of CSS that I had no idea about. Again, a super humbling experience. I wrote my clock in a React kind of way by declaring my own Clock class and adding some state and methods to act on the clock.

## Day 3: Playing with CSS Variables and Array Cardio 1
I only read headlines about CSS variables and never played around with them. I definitely found the first course helpful.
